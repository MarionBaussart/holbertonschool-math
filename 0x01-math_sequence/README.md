# 0x01-math_sequence

## 0. The Heron sequence
The Heron sequence is defined by: un+1 = 1/2 (un + (b/un)) with u0 = 1.

Write a function that return the Heron sequence until having convergence with an error less or equal to 10^-7.

* Prototype: t_cell *heron(double p, double x0);
* You must use linked lists.
